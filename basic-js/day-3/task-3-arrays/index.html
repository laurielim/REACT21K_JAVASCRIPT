    <h1>Practice Exercise</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an **array of 5 elements**, each element is a random number of either 1 or 0</li>
        <li>Create a while loop, that goes through each element in the array, check if they are 1 or 0</li>
        <li>Also create a counter variable to keep track of the number of 1 and 0 values in the array</li>
        <li>If the number of 1s is 5, announce the jackpot prize</li>
        <li>If the number of 0s is 5, announce the congrat message</li>
        <li>If the number of 1s is 3 < x < 5, announce smaller prize</li>
        <li>Create a while loop that will run the above application for an undefinite number of time, and only break out of the loop if the jackpot prize is won.</li>
        <li>Create a variable to keep track of many rounds have been played in order to win the jackpot</li>
        <li>If each round costs 50 cents, run the above program 5 times, either manually or use a while loop to help you, in order to learn the average amount of money you have to spend on winning a jackpot ðŸ˜„</li>
        <li>Increase the random number range to be any number between 0 - 5, run the program on number 9 again to see how much money you would actually have to spend to win a jackpot</li>
        <li>If the jackpot prize was 30000 EUR, how much profit/loss do you make?</li>
