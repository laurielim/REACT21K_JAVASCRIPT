    <ul>
        <li>Create a software that generate 5 random numbers of either 0 or 1</li>
        <li>Let the user knows which are the 5 random numbers that they have gotten with console.log or alert</li>
        <li>If the user get all five 1s, congrat the user because he/she has won a jackpot prize.</li>
