## Instructions

1. Create an **array of 5 elements**, each element is a random number of either 1 or 0
2. Create a while loop, that goes through each element in the array, check if they are 1 or 0
3. Also create a counter variable to keep track of the number of 1 and 0 values in the array
4. If the number of 1s is 5, announce the jackpot prize
5. If the number of 0s is 5, announce the congrat message

7. Create a while loop that will run the above application for an undefinite number of time, and only break out of the loop if the jackpot prize is won.
8. Create a variable to keep track of many rounds have been played in order to win the jackpot
9. If each round costs 50 cents, run the above program 5 times, either manually or use a while loop to help you, in order to learn the average amount of money you have to spend on winning a jackpot ðŸ˜„
10. Increase the random number range to be any number between 0 - 5, run the program on number 9 again to see how much money you would actually have to spend to win a jackpot
