# Class Exercises on Arrays

## Instructions

1. You are provided with 2 arrays, firstArray, and secondArray. Make a new thirdArray, that contains elements of the firstArray, followed by elements of the secondArray.
1. You are provided with an array of numbers. Create another array that contains elements of the provided array, but in reverse order. Do not use .reverse() method.
1. You are provided with an array that contains some duplicated elements. Create another array that contains ONLY unique elements of the given array. The order of the new array isn't important.
1. You are provided 2 arrays. Write a logic that will compare elements of the 2 arrays to find out if they contain same elements. It is possible that the one of the array is a sub array of the other, in which case they shouldn't be considered as containing same elements. The order of elements in each array can be different
1. The following array is nested (having array inside array). You need to create a new array that will deconstruct the nested array so that it is no longer nested. The order isn't important.
1. The array you are given contains all kinds of personal information. Filter out all email addresses into a separate array. Filter out all phone numbers into a separate array
1. The current array contains a sample text. Use the .split(' ') method to split the paragraph to an array of words. Iterate through the array of words, check if each word contain the letter 'o'. If it does, store a value of 1 to a newArray, otherwise 0. Example:
   - sample = ['Lorem', 'ipsum', 'dolor', 'sit']
   - result = [1, 0, 1, 0]
